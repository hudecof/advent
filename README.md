# Advent of Code

These are my solition for the problem descriptions on the http://adventofcode.com/

Of course, there could be better one

- better code
- less memory space used
- faster

## General notes

In each directory teher are mostly 2 scripts `part1.py` and `part2.py`. Teh second one is the copy
of the first one with modifications to fit the chnaged problem description.

### Input
There is in most cases file with name `input`. Yu can find tere the input data for the problem.
Any other file prefixed with `input` is my testing data.

For some solutions, the input is hardcoded in variable `input` in the code.

### Output
There are several output types

- **integer** - paste this into the input box, it's a result
- **bunch of lines* - you need to do sort/uniq/tail/head on this output

See README in each directory for more informations.
